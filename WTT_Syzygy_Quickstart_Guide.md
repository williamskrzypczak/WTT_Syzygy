### Liquidity Zones
- **Weak**: Low volume strength zones (gray/teal with high transparency)
- **Moderate**: Medium volume strength zones (medium transparency)
- **Strong**: High volume strength zones (low transparency, bold text)

## Trading Applications

### Entry Signals
1. **Volume Spike + Zone Interaction**: Look for volume spikes near support/resistance zones
2. **Zone Penetration**: Monitor for significant penetration into key zones
3. **Daily Levels**: Use daily high/low as additional reference points

### Risk Management
- Volume spikes provide momentum confirmation
- Support/resistance zones offer key levels for stop losses
- Zone penetration alerts help identify potential reversals
